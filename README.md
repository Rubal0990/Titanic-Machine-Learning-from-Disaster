## Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster
After knowing basics of machine learning, tried this Mini Machine Learning Project for better understanding of data analysis and machine learning algorithms. I made this using Jupyter Notebook for the Kaggle competition, Titanic Machine Learning From Disaster. Kaggle provides many interesting problems for aspiring machine learning students.

## Dependencies:
* NumPy
* Pandas
* SciKit-Learn
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib
* Joblib

### **This Notebook will show basic examples of:**
### Data Handling
* Importing Data with Pandas
* Cleaning Data
* Exploring Data through Visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn
### Data Analysis
* Supervised Machine learning Techniques: Logistic Regression Model + Plotting results
### Valuation of the Analysis
* precision, recall, f1-score to valuate results locally
